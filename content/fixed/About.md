I'm a [freelance database developer](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/gavincampbell "LinkedIn, if you insist...") specialised in improving working practices in database delivery through the use of tools such as [SQL Server Data Tools](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ssdt/), [tSQLt](http://tsqlt.org/), [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), on platforms such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com), and methodologies such as Continuous Delivery and Agile. 

I [present at conferences and user groups now and then]({{< relref "fixed/Speaking.md">}}), as well as engaging in intermittent flurries of activity on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1100346/gavin-campbell). I occasionally write about less technical things at [dev.to](https://dev.to/gavincampbell). You can even talk to me in person through the magic of [officehours.io](https://officehours.io/people/arapaima).
