I'm a database developer specialised in improving working practices in database delivery through the use of tools such as [SQL Server Data Tools](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ssdt/), [tSQLt](http://tsqlt.org/), [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), on platforms such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com), and methodologies such as Continuous Delivery and Agile. 

As a strictly time-limited promotion, all purchases of "DevOps" made through this site will come with a voucher for a free "Big Data"[^1].

I present at conferences and user groups now and then, as well as engaging in intermittent flurries of activity on StackOverflow.
